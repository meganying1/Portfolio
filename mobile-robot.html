              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In this project, I worked in a team to program a mobile robot using Arduino.
                Our goal was to design a control algorithm to allow the robot to complete an
                obstacle course as quickly as possible. The course involved follow a curved
                line and avoiding a series of sliding walls. 
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Code</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our robot used a differential drive mechanism, meaning it had wheels on each
                side that were attached to their own motors. Our program works by taking input 
                from an ultrasonic sensor and an infrared sensor and using it to send desired 
                voltages to each of the motors.  During the first stage of developing our code, 
                my team tested which values we needed to use to determine whether the line 
                tracking sensors detected the line. We created a program that would print the 
                values from the sensors when it was directly placed on the line. Consequently, 
                we were able to tune our program to recognize the robot was on the line when the 
                sensors reported a value over a specific number. Additionally, our program would
                turn off the motors of our robot when the ultrasonic sensor detected an object
                within a certain distance.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The loop section of our code includes several if statements that allows the program
                to check whether the robot is on the line and whether there is an obstacle. 
                One set of if statements allowed the algorithm to determine which infrared 
                sensor, left, right, or middle, last detected once the robot no longer follows 
                the line. If the line was last on the right side, our algorithm would set the motor
                voltages so that the robot turns to the left, causing it to navigate back to the 
                line. The same applies for if the line was last detected on the left side. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We also used a series of if statements to control the speed at which our robot
                navigated. If an object was detected by the ultrasonic sensor, the voltages sent
                to both motors was 0 volts. If the middle infrared sensor is the only sensor on 
                the line, the speed of both motors is equal. However, if the middle and left sensors
                both detect the line the line, the left motor speed is set to a number slightly 
                smaller than the right motor speed. This is to ensure that the robot does not turn 
                too quickly in the opposite direction. The same applies if a line is detected by 
                the middle and right sensors. If only the left or right sensor detects the line, 
                the different between the speed of the right and left motors increases to turn the
                robot more quickly.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              During the testing of our program, our robot was able to avoid all the moving 
                obstacles and finish the course in 26 seconds, which was quicker than 75% of 
                other robots. It successfully steered itself back onto the line when it sensed
                that it had left the line. This project allowed me to practice coding using 
                Arduino and converting sensor readings to voltages. I was also able to study
                the kinematics of differential drive robots.
