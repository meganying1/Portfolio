              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                For our MechE Capstone course, 24-441: Product design, my team and I were tasked with designing 
                and fabricating a product with a significant mechanical component, given a budget of $800. We 
                chose to develop a trash compactor for reducing trash volume and minimizing bag consumption. 
                Our product targets homeowners, particularly in pay-as-you-throw communities, where residents 
                are charged based on the amount of waste they generate.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Design Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We began by analyzing competitor products, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. Many 
                options required manual user force or were expensive and required professional installation. We 
                were inspired to develop an affordable, compact, and user-friendly product, brainstorming 
                potential designs ideas. After ranking them based on effectiveness, durability, feasibility, and 
                ease of use, we selected our final design. Throughout the design process, we applied Design for 
                Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Design for 
                Environment (DFE) principles.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our prototype features a compacting system housed inside a wooden trash bin, designed to be fully
                operational with no user assembly required. The system utilizes a scissor lift mechanism to compress 
                household trash. When the user presses a button, the linkage system pushes a plate upward to compress 
                the trash against the lid, holds the position for 10 seconds, and then retracts. The base of the 
                compactor contains a box housing the systemâ€™s key electrical components: a linear actuator, a stepper 
                motor, and an Arduino board. The motor is powered by a standard outlet, while the Arduino is powered 
                by a battery pack. The compactor also features a latching system to allow the user to securely lock 
                the lid in place.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
                Our linkage system is constructed from aluminum bars and rods, which we machined using a manual 
                lathe and mill. To connect the linkage system to the compactor plate, my team and I used aluminum 
                L-brackets, which were also machined with a mill. For attaching the linkage system to the linear 
                actuator, we designed custom attachments in SolidWorks and fabricated them out of PLA using 3D 
                printing. Additionally, we cut and assembled the wood for the trash bin receptacle, securing the 
                panels, hinges, and locking mechanism in place with screws. While the prototype closely resembles 
                the final design, mass production would use different materials and methods for scalability.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our team conducted both hand calculations and a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation on 
                the wings of our product. We opted for a high factor of safety to ensure durability, allowing
                the product to undergo many opening and closing cycles before needed to be replaced. 
                After finalizing our design, we estimated the cost of our product by obtaining a quote
                for components from Protolabs, based on a sample quantity of 50. Although our prototype
                was fabricated using 3D printing, we determined that injection molding would be the
                preferred manufacturing method due to its efficiency, enabling more parts to be produced 
                at a lower cost pepr unit. According to our calculations, the total cost of manufacturing 
                and assembling our product would be approximately $58. Thus, we set the price of our 
                attachment at around $62, allowing for a 7% profit margin.

                My team successfully fabricated a fully functional model of our tripod attachment.
                Through this project, I developed a better understanding of the various aspects
