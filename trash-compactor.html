              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                For our MechE Capstone course, 24-441: Product design, my team and I were tasked with designing 
                and fabricating a product with a significant mechanical component, given a budget of $800. We 
                chose to develop a trash compactor for reducing trash volume and minimizing bag consumption. 
                Our product targets homeowners, particularly in pay-as-you-throw communities, where residents 
                are charged based on the amount of waste they generate.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Design Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We began by analyzing competitor products, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. Many 
                options required manual user force or were expensive and required professional installation. We 
                were inspired to develop an affordable, compact, and user-friendly product, brainstorming 
                potential designs ideas. After ranking them based on effectiveness, durability, feasibility, and 
                ease of use, we selected our final design. Throughout the design process, we applied Design for 
                Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Design for 
                Environment (DFE) principles.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our prototype features a compacting system housed inside a wooden trash bin, designed to be fully
                operational with no user assembly required. The system utilizes a scissor lift mechanism to compress 
                household trash. When the user presses a button, the linkage system pushes a plate upward to compress 
                the trash against the lid, holds the position for 10 seconds, and then retracts. The base of the 
                compactor contains a box housing the system’s key electrical components: a linear actuator, a stepper 
                motor, and an Arduino board. The motor is powered by a standard outlet, while the Arduino is powered 
                by a battery pack. The compactor also features a latching system to allow the user to securely lock 
                the lid in place.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
                Our linkage system is constructed from aluminum bars and rods, which we machined using a manual 
                lathe and mill. To connect the linkage system to the compactor plate, my team and I used aluminum 
                L-brackets, which were also machined with a mill. For attaching the linkage system to the linear 
                actuator, we designed custom attachments in SolidWorks and fabricated them out of PLA using 3D 
                printing. Additionally, we cut and assembled the wood for the trash bin receptacle, securing the 
                panels, hinges, and locking mechanism in place with screws. While the prototype closely resembles 
                the final design, mass production would use different materials and methods for scalability.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Analysis Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To aid prototyping, we developed detailed CAD models of the system, which allowed us to 
                determine the correct dimensions for our linkage system and wooden bin. We also performed 
                hand calculations to estimate the motor’s strength and the weight the linkage system could 
                support, considering both worst-case and best-case scenarios. In the worst-case scenario, 
                we assumed the roller as the only support point, while the best-case scenario assumed an 
                even distribution of force between the pin and roller. These calculations suggested the 
                system could support a load between 6.4 to 12.8 lbs without stalling. Further analysis 
                revealed a Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1160 for a 6.4-lb load and 124 for a 60-lb load, which 
                we determined was ideal for compressing trash through testing. Based on these findings, we 
                identified that the motor’s load capacity was the limiting factor in the system’s strength. 
                As a result, we plan to include a stronger motor in the final design for mass production.
