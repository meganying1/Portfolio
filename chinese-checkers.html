                Chinese Checkers was my final project for 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming
                and Computer Science. I created it by implementing object-oriented programming
                in Python. My program also used Tkinter, which is a part of Python’s standard
                GUI. The program includes the basic gameplay of Chinese checkers, as well as
                additional features. The user can play against an AI opponent or against friends
                and can request for a hint. It also includes timed turns. You can view a
                demonstration of my program here: https://youtu.be/EQbkK0stQs8. 
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Complex Features</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In Chinese checkers, the game board is not a perfect grid. The even and odd
                rows are offset from each other. This made drawing the board, determining
                row and column coordinates, and making the basic gameplay more complicated.
                The function I used to get the x-y coordinates of a cell based on its row and
                column, and vice versa, needed to add or subtract an offset. In addition, to
                account for this offset when moving pieces, my program determines when the
                change in column must be adjusted.

                Another complex part of my code includes the algorithm for allowing the player
                piece to continue jumping over other pieces once it has started. I used a variable
                that was set to True when the current player was jumping and False otherwise. When
                the variable is set to True, the user can only make jumping moves, and their turn
                does not end until they click elsewhere on the board.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Adding animations for the ball movements was also one of my more difficult tasks.
                To implement this, I used a variable of each ball that states whether it is moving
                or not. If this variable is set to True, my program will calculate the necessary 
                change in the ball’s x-y coordinates needed over a set amount of time, redrawing 
                the ball until it reaches its new location.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                My code also uses minimax to allow for the user to play against an opponent AI.
                I used object-oriented programming to create a data tree of all possible game states.
                My program assigns a value to each state based on how beneficial it is for the AI.
                It then goes through each branch of the data tree to find the optimal path. This
                backtracking algorithm also allows the user to request for hints.

                My friends and I use my program to play Chinese checkers against each other.
                This project taught me how to approach creating a piece of complex code with little
                guidance. Through completing it, I learned more about different packages and features
                that can be used in Python. I also became more comfortable with using recursive
                functions and object-oriented programming. Lastly, I was able to improve my ability
                to detect bugs in my code.
