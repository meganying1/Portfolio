              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                During this project, I collaborated with a team to develop assistive technology
                tailored to a particular user group. We focused on designing a tripod attachment 
                for individuals with cerebral palsy or wrist tendonitis, enabling them to take 
                photos with ease. Our objective was to manufacture a prototype of the product within
                a budget of $200, while also ensuring that our design could be mass-manufactured 
                efficiently.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Design Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We began our design process by crafting a user survey. Our interviews revealed that 
                small components of the tripod, like wheels and levers, posed significant challenges 
                for our target population. Consequently, we made it a priority to eliminate the need 
                to screw a camera onto the tripod, as well as to adjust knobs for swivel and tilt.
                We brainstormed potential mechanisms for each function and utilized
                metrics to guide our final design selection.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Product Features</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our final product is an attachment designed to seamlessly integrate with any tripod.
                It automates the process of securing a phone within a tripod, preventing the user from
                needing to apply any additional force and reducing the need for steady hands. The base of
                our product is made from ABS, a rigid material, and houses an IR sensor. When the sensor
                detects the presense of phone, a pair of wings, which are powered by micro servos, 
                a nano board, and a 9V battery, open and close to secure the phone within the slot. To
                remove the phone after use, users can simply pull it out of the subassembly. The base slot
                is lined with foam and the wings are made from a flexible material called TPU, allowing 
                the attachment to accommodate phones of varying sizes.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
                In addition, our design incorporates an interface piece attached beneath the base.
                The inner interface is made from TPU, while the outer portion is made from ABS. Both
                components feature rounded gear teeth for easier swiveling and locking. As a result, users 
                can twist the subassembly without needing to loosen any knobs. Furthermore, we integrated 
                magnet holes into our design. These magnets enable the inner and outer pieces to snap 
                together securely, while also allowing the parts to be easily dismantled.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our team conducted both hand calculations and a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation on 
                the wings of our product. We opted for a high factor of safety to ensure durability, allowing
                the product to undergo many opening and closing cycles before needed to be replaced. 
                After finalizing our design, we estimated the cost of our product by obtaining a quote
                for components from Protolabs, based on a sample quantity of 50. Although our prototype
                was fabricated using 3D printing, we determined that injection molding would be the
                preferred manufacturing method due to its efficiency, enabling more parts to be produced 
                at a lower cost pepr unit. According to our calculations, the total cost of manufacturing 
                and assembling our product would be approximately $58. Thus, we set the price of our 
                attachment at around $62, allowing for a 7% profit margin.
