              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Throughout this project, I worked with a team to design assistive technology for a 
                specific population. We chose to create a tripod attachment that could be used by
                those with cerebral palsy or wrist tendonitis to take photos. We were given the 
                task of fabricating a prototype of the product given a budget of $200. In addition,
                we needed to consider the mass manufacturing process for our design.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Design Process</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We began by creating a user survey. Through our interviews, we identified that 
                small mechanisms of the tripod, such as wheels and levers, were most difficult 
                to use for our target population. Thus, we focused on eliminating the need to 
                screw a camera into a tripod, as well as the need to adjust knobs for the swivel 
                and tilt features. Our team brainstormed various mechanisms for each function. We 
                consulted with faculty and ranked each mechanism using metrics to select our final
                design.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Product Features</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our final product is an attachment that can be screwed into any tripod. It is
                capable of automatically securing a phone, preventing the user from needing to
                apply any extraneous force and reducing the need for steady hands. The base of
                our product, which is made of a rigid material known as ABS, houses an IR sensor,
                which can detect when a phone is being held over it. A pair of wings powered by
                micro servos, a nano board, and a 9V battery then open and close to allow the user
                to place a phone in the slot. Once the user has finished taking photos, the phone
                can be removed by pulling it out of the subassembly. The slot of the base is
                lined with foam and the wings are made of TPU, a flexible material. This allows
                our product to accommodate phones of various widths and lengths.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
                Our design also includes an interface piece attached under the base. The inner
                interface is made of TPU, while the outer portion is made of ABS. Both components
                have rounded gear teeth for easier swiveling and locking. As a result, the user
                can twist the subassembly without needing to loosen any knobs. We also included
                holes for magnets in our design. These magnets cause the inner and outer pieces
                to snap into place, while allowing the parts to be easily dismantled.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Our team performed hand calculations, as well as an FEA simulation, on the wings of our
                product. We chose to have a high factor of safety to ensure that the product is durable,
                and thus, can be used many times before needing to be replaced. We also made cost
                estimations for our product by submitting a quote of our components to Protolabs using
                a sample quantity of 50. Although our prototype was fabricated using 3D printing,
                we decided that our mass manufacturing method would be injection molding. This method
                is very efficient and therefore, more parts can be created at a lower price for each.
                Based on our calculations, our product would cost approximately $58 to manufacture and
                assemble. Thus, we decided to price our attachment at around $62 to account for a 7% profit.

                My team was able to fabricate a functioning model of our tripod attachment. Through
                this project, I developed a better understanding of the different factors that go
                into mass manufacturing of a product, including material selection and manufacturing
                methods. I also gained hands-on experience with incorporating electronics into mechanical
                systems.
