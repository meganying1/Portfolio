                For this project, my team and I were tasked with performing numerical analysis on a problem of our 
                choice,incorporating real-world data. We implemented the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm to 
                reduce noise amplitude in sound samples collected from various campus locations. The algorithm 
                was designed to selectively filter background noise while preserving critical emergency sounds.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Algorithm Selection</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We initially explored Destructive Interference, a common Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) method used 
                in noise-canceling headphones. This approach relies on combining two waves of the same amplitude but 
                opposite phase to cancel each other out. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we created a MATLAB script 
                that completely canceled a noise wave by inverting its phase. While this method effectively eliminates 
                noise, its limitations for real-time noise cancellation and lack of safety by blocking out certain 
                sounds led us to explore alternative algorithms.

                To address the limitations of Destructive Interference, we implemented the Least Mean Squares (LMS) 
                algorithm. The LMS algorithm adapts dynamically to changes in the input signal, eliminating the need 
                for real-time inversion of sound waves. Instead, it uses the steepest descent statistical analysis 
                technique to iteratively update the coefficients of a digital filter. This minimizes the error between 
                the output signal and the desired reference, enabling the LMS algorithm to "learn" and continuously 
                improve its noise-filtering effectiveness over time.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To implement our noise cancellation algorithm, we developed a MATLAB script that processes an audio 
                file by converting it to mono-channel format, since the algorithm only supports single-channel audio. 
                The script generates white noise with an amplitude matching the average amplitude of the original audio. 
                The desired clean signal is obtained by subtracting the noise from the original audio. The LMS algorithm 
                is then applied, where the filterâ€™s complexity is determined by the filter length, and the step size 
                influences the rate of convergence and stability. The code enables us to compare the original and cleaned 
                signals both visually, through plotting the signals, and audibly, by playing the audio files.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                We collected noise samples from various high-traffic locations on campus, such as the gym, the lawn, 
                buses, and study spots. We then ran our MATLAB code on these samples, generating graphs of the original 
                and cleaned audio signals. Finally, we were able to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm by measuring 
                the reduction in noise amplitude, as well as by listening to our audio files.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                My team and I found that our algorithm was capable of reducing sound by up to 95%, while still allowing 
                emergency signals to be heard. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with MATLAB scripting. 
                I was also able to deepen my understanding of various algorithms and statistical techniques.
